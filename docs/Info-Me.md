I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Natural Resource Conservation at the University of Florida.
Currently, I work at two institutions, UF and FWC.
I am a research assistant in Dr. Silvana Paula-Moraes' entomology lab, and a Steidinger Scholars summer intern at the FWRI at Garcon Point.
For Dr. Moraes, I assist with the data collection of various research projects regarding key agricultural pests in the FL Panhandle,
and I am also independently working on two research projects. For FWRI, I primarily assist with research on non-game fish species,
specifically their habitat and movement near/within the FL Panhandle. Because I am interested in many subjects related to natural
resources, I intend to narrow my interests to find a career about which I am most passionate. I am always looking for volunteer
opportunities in subjects with which I am unfamiliar so I can learn more about natural resources-related fields.
