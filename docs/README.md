## About me

I am in my final year at the University of Florida in Milton, studying Natural Resource Conservation. Currently, I work at two institutions, UF and FWC. I am a research assistant in Dr. Silvana Paula-Moraes' entomology lab, and a Steidinger Scholars summer intern at the FWC-FWRI at Garcon Point. Because I am interested in many subjects related to natural resources, I intend to narrow my interests to find a career about which I am most passionate. **I am always looking for volunteer opportunities in subjects with which I am unfamiliar so I can learn more about fields related to natural resources.**
